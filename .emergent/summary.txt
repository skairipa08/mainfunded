<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a GoFundMe clone named FundEd for educational fundraising.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (MVP Summary):**
-   **Platform Name:** FundEd
-   **Core Idea:** A crowdfunding platform for verified students to raise funds for educational needs.
-   **User Roles:** Student, Donor, Institution/Company, Admin.
-   **Authentication:** Google Social Login.
-   **Campaigns:** Student-created, admin-verified campaigns with progress tracking.
-   **Donations:** Stripe integration with a donor wall.
-   **Features:** Browse/search campaigns, social sharing, simple Impact Log.
-   **Design:** Modern, clean, unique, ESG-style UI.
-   **Deployment:** The application must be fully self-hostable using Docker, with no lock-in to the Emergent platform. All dependencies, environment variables, and setup steps must be clearly documented.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React + FastAPI) has been developed. The backend includes models and APIs for users, campaigns, and donations. The frontend is fully integrated with the backend, replacing the initial mock data. A comprehensive production-readiness pass was completed, which included adding Docker files, environment examples (), a detailed README, CI/CD workflow (), and removing all dependencies on the Emergent platform's internal libraries in favor of standard, self-hostable solutions for Google OAuth and Stripe.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The user provided a high-priority, focused request to ensure two critical features are robust and fully self-hostable: Google OAuth and the Stripe webhook for reliable donation tracking. The agent was reviewing the existing implementation files (, , ) to verify they meet the user's stringent requirements for idempotency and signature verification.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Not for the user's latest, specific P0 requirements. Previous tests showed a Stripe key issue, which prompted the user's new, more detailed instructions.)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** both
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: Finalize and Verify Self-Hosted Google OAuth & Stripe Webhooks (P0)**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has already implemented a self-hosted version of these features. However, the user's last message implies a need for a strict final review and potential refinement to guarantee production readiness. The Stripe payment test failed previously due to an invalid test key, and the user now wants to ensure the underlying webhook logic (signature verification, idempotency, status persistence) is flawless.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Stripe Webhook:** Review . Ensure Stripe signature verification using  is correctly implemented. Confirm the handler correctly parses events (, , ) and updates the donation status in the database.
        2.  **Stripe Idempotency:** Review . Confirm that idempotency keys are being used when creating donations to prevent duplicates.
        3.  **Google OAuth:** Review  and . Verify that the entire login flow works end-to-end using the standard Google OAuth libraries and environment variables (, ).
        4.  **Documentation:** Double-check  and the  files to ensure the instructions for setting up Google OAuth credentials (including redirect URIs) and Stripe webhooks are complete and easy to follow.
        5.  **Testing:** After verification, run both backend and frontend tests to confirm the entire flow: Login -> Create Campaign -> Donate -> Verify Donation Status.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will satisfy the user's highest priority request, making the application's core auth and payment flows reliable and truly self-hostable.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
None separate from the P0 issue above.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Future Tasks (As per user request in Chat Message 193):**
    *   **P1: File Uploads:** Integrate a real storage provider like Cloudinary or S3 for campaign images and verification documents. The current implementation in  is a mock.
    *   **P1: Admin Initialization:** Replace the hardcoded admin user. Make the initial admin configurable via an environment variable () or a one-time setup script.
    *   **P1: Security Hardening:** Verify that rate limiting is effective and that production CORS settings are appropriately strict.
    *   **P1: Automated Checks:** Verify the GitHub Actions CI workflow in  works correctly.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Strict User Priority:** The user's last message (Chat Message 282) is the top priority. Focus ONLY on verifying and finalizing the self-hosted Google OAuth and Stripe webhook implementations. Do not work on other features until these are confirmed to be robust and reliable.
- **Self-Hosting is Key:** The entire goal of the recent work is to make the application fully independent and self-hostable. All solutions must use standard open-source libraries and rely on environment variables for configuration, as documented in the  files.
- **Missing File:** The agent failed to create  (Chat Message 143). This file is required for the development setup defined in  and should be created.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
- **User (282):** High-priority request to ONLY implement/verify self-hosted Google OAuth and reliable Stripe webhooks (with idempotency and signature verification). Explicitly told the agent to stop after these two items. (Status: IN PROGRESS)
- **Agent (281):** Provided a summary of the production-readiness pass.
- **Agent (280):** Confirmed all production files are in place.
- **User (193):** Provided a detailed list of production-readiness requirements, including self-hosted OAuth, proper Stripe webhooks, file uploads (S3/Cloudinary), admin management, security hardening, and CI. (Status: Partially implemented, with P0 items prioritized by user in message 282).
- **Agent (192):** Provided a summary of the initial full-stack implementation.
- **User (107):** Requested a full production-readiness pass to make the repo self-hostable, with Docker, a README, and proper environment variable setup. (Status: Addressed, but now being refined).
- **Agent (106):** Finished initial backend/frontend integration and testing.
- **Agent (105):** Reported that all backend and frontend tests passed.
- **User (5):** Approved the frontend design and gave the green light for backend development, instructing the agent to use the provided test Stripe key and seed a default admin user. (Status: Completed).
- **Agent (4):** Sent plan to user for approval.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:**
    - The donation flow is not functional until a user provides their own valid Stripe API keys and webhook secret in the environment files. This is by design for a self-hosted app.
    - The local development environment via  may be broken because  is missing.
- **Mocked:**
    - The file upload endpoint () returns a hardcoded placeholder URL. It is not connected to a real storage service.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Google OAuth 2.0:** Implemented for user authentication. Requires user-provided  and .
- **Stripe:** Implemented for payments. Requires user-provided , , and .
- **Cloudinary:** Library is installed, but the integration for file uploads is planned and not yet implemented.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
- **Test files created:** [, ]
- **Known regressions:** The Stripe donation flow failed in the last test run due to using a platform-specific test key (). This is expected and will be resolved when a user provides their own key for self-hosting.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. The application is now designed to be self-hosted. The user must provide their own credentials for Google and Stripe by creating  files based on the  templates.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent failed to create  during the  call (Chat Message 143) due to a tool error. It did not retry or acknowledge the failure, leaving the docker-compose development setup incomplete.</analysis>
